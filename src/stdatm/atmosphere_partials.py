class AtmosphereWithPartials(Atmosphere):
    """
    Implementation of International Standard Atmosphere for troposphere and stratosphere with
    derivatives of state parameters with respect to altitude.

    Atmosphere properties and partials are provided in the same "shape" as provided
    altitude:

    - if altitude is given as a float, returned values will be floats
    - if altitude is given as a sequence (list, 1D numpy array, ...), returned
      values will be 1D numpy arrays
    - if altitude is given as nD numpy array, returned values will be nD numpy
      arrays

    The AtmosphereWithPartials class inherits from the Atmosphere class and thus retains its usages.
    It however adds the computation of the partial derivatives of all state properties with respect
    to the altitude.

    Usage:

    .. code-block::

        >>> from stdatm import AtmosphereWithPartials
        >>> pressure = AtmosphereWithPartials(30000).pressure # pressure at 30,000 feet, dISA = 0 K
        >>> # pressure at 30,000 feet, dISA = 0 K
        >>> partials_pressure_altitude = AtmosphereWithPartials(30000).partial_pressure_altitude

        >>> # init for alt. 0, 10,000 and 30,000 feet
        >>> atm = AtmosphereWithPartials([0.0,10000.0,30000.0])
